# Credit-Data-Analysis
• This analysis explores a comprehensive consumer loan dataset that combines credit bureau
information with loan application data to understand factors influencing loan defaults. The
dataset comprises 41 features covering essential aspects of credit assessment, including credit
scores, account histories, identity verification statuses, and loan-specific details.
• The data encompasses three main categories:
– Credit Bureau Information: Including credit scores, account histories, and payment
behaviors
– Loan Details: Covering disbursement amounts, asset costs, and loan-to-value ratios
– Borrower Information: Containing verification statuses, employment type, and geographical indicators
• Through this exploratory analysis, we aim to uncover significant patterns and relationships
between these variables and loan default outcomes. The insights derived will be valuable for
improving risk assessment methodologies and lending decisions while maintaining responsible
lending practices
